## Evaluation sites & leaderboards
- [Scale](scale.com/leaderboard) (different benchmarks)
- [LMArena](lmarena.ai) (blind user tests evaluation with elo system)
## How do LLMs actually work?
- [[How do LLMs work?]]
## When to ask a LLM 
- If you are asking a question, that is **not based on very recent events/discoveries**
- If the question you are asking, is pobably **very commonly asked on the internet** or the **topic is often discussed**
## What to keep in mind 
- If switching topic: **start new chat** (to reset context window)
- Consider which model you are using 
  --> easy tasks should not use reasoning models
  --> harder tasks should use reasoning models
## Tool usage 
- [[LLM tool examples]]
- Kind of like my understanding of agents
- Super useful e.g. for reading a paper and having a "assistant to ask questions" in a different tab
- Always be a bit suspicious about its answers
## Voice mode 
- easier to use - sorta like an assistant
- best way to use is probably text-to-speech tools (https://github.com/braden-w/whispering)
