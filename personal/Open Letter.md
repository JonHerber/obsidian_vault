Dear Ottonova Team,

We, the working students at Ottonova, gratefully appreciate the positive and supportive work environment you provide. We greatly appreciate the benefits already provided and value that our voices are welcomed when suggesting new ideas.

With this in mind, we would like to request participation in the Wellpass program. We believe that joining Wellpass will further enhance our work-health balance—a benefit that becomes even more valuable given the high cost of living and the limited, often pricey wellness and sports opportunities available in Munich. While the university sports offerings are appreciated, their capacity and variety can be limited. Many other companies extend more comprehensive wellness benefits to their working students, and we feel that Wellpass would significantly improve our quality of life here at Ottonova.

One significant advantage of Wellpass is its ability to provide a unique, inclusive experience. By offering a diverse array of options—from various sports and yoga sessions to wellness classes and more—it serves as a "one size fits all" solution that meets the varied interests of every working student, rather than simply subsidizing a single facility like a weightlifting gym. As you emphasized in the penultimate All-Hands meeting, Ottonova is dedicated to the physical and mental well-being of its employees, and we see this as a prime opportunity to enhance that commitment even further.

Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to continuing our contribution to a fostering a vibrant and healthy workplace.

Sincerely,

The Working Students at Ottonova
